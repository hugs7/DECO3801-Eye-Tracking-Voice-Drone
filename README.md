## Motivation

Traditional drone control methods rely on physical controllers, a mobile device, or perhaps a VR headset. While these methods are very precise, they bring a steep learning curve and can take time to master. They can also limit the pilot's ability to multitask or focus on other important tasks for a given application involving drones.

This project seeks to simplify the task of piloting a drone using gaze tracking and voice control to provide a hands-free control environment. Not only does this enable beginners to more easily fly a drone, but it also would allow more focus on the task at hand which could be critical in certain applications.
